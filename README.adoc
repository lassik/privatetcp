privatetcp
==========

What does it do
---------------

**privatetcp** is a TCP multiplexer that lets local users create their
own TCP servers on convenient port numbers (such as the standard HTTP
port 80). The same port number is shared by all users on the computer
but each user controls the program that runs when they connect to it.

**privatetcp** runs on Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and
DragonFly BSD. It requires no configuration apart from the port
numbers to use. It is normally started from launchd, systemd,
daemontools or another service supervisor.

See the link:privatetcp.1.adoc[privatetcp(1) manual page] for details.
