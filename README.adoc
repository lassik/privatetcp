**privatetcp** is a TCP multiplexer that lets local users create their
own TCP servers on convenient port numbers (such as the standard HTTP
port 80). The same port number is shared by all users on the computer
but each user controls the program that runs when they personally
connect to it.  For example, each user can have their own web server
on port 80, isolated from other users' web servers.

**privatetcp** runs on Linux, MacOS, FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD and
DragonFly BSD. It requires no configuration apart from the port
numbers to use. It is normally started from launchd, systemd,
daemontools or another service supervisor.

See the link:privatetcp.1.adoc[privatetcp(1) manual page] for details.
