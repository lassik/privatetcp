NAME
----

*privatetcp* - private TCP servers for local users on shared ports

SYNOPSIS
--------

*privatetcp* *port* [*port* ...]

DESCRIPTION
-----------

*privatetcp* lets local users create their own TCP servers on
convenient port numbers (such as the standard HTTP port 80). The same
port number is shared by all users on the computer.  *privatetcp* runs
as root and listens on the port, multiplexing it to provide different
service to different TCP clients depending on which local user is at
the other end of the connection. For example, each local user could
point their web browser to `http://localhost` and see a completely
different website, served by their own private web server that is
isolated from other users' web servers.

When *privatetcp* starts up, it creates a loopback TCP server on each
*port* given on the command line. (Service names such as `http` are
also accepted in place of port numbers.) It then accepts clients on
those ports until it receives the SIGTERM signal that tells it to
exit. For each client, *privatetcp* finds out which local user ID made
the connection. It then asserts that the user ID is reasonable and
that the user is allowed to login, switches to that user ID and group
ID, changes to that user's home directory, sets *LOGNAME*, *USER*,
*HOME*, *SHELL*, and *PATH*, and executes the file
`~/.privatetcp`. The file must have execute permission (`chmod u+x
~/.privatetcp`). It can be a binary executable, a shell script, or any
other script with a valid shebang line (i.e. the first line of the
file must start with `#!` and give the pathname of the interpreter to
use).

Upon successful execution of `~/.privatetcp` the standard error stream
is closed so users' personal log messages don't clutter the
system-wide log. The first thing `~/.privatetcp` should do is to
re-open standard error to write into a log file, otherwise you may
lose log messages.  Standard input and standard output are connected
to the TCP client socket. This means you can simply read from standard
input to read network traffic from the client, and write to standard
output to write to the client. It's also possible to use Unix system
calls like `fcntl` and `setsockopt` that operate on sockets.

In addition to the standard environment variables listed above, the
environment variable `PORT` is set to the port number of the server
port and `SERVICE` is set to the equivalent service name in
`/etc/services` (for example `PORT=80` corresponds to
`SERVICE=http`). Environment variables specified by *UCSPI-TCP*
(https://cr.yp.to/proto/ucspi-tcp.txt) are also set as follows:

    PROTO=TCP
    TCPLOCALIP=127.0.0.1
    TCPLOCALHOST=localhost
    TCPLOCALPORT=$PORT
    TCPREMOTEIP=127.0.0.1
    TCPREMOTEHOST=localhost
    TCPREMOTEPORT=<client port>
    TCPREMOTEINFO=$USER

SYSTEM ADMINISTRATION
---------------------

The *privatetcp* multiplexer writes all error and log messages to
standard error. It does not create log files, write to syslog or
timestamp its own logs. It also does not put itself into the
background or maintain a PID file. The system administrator is
expected to set up supervision and logging according to local customs.

SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS
-----------------------

*privatetcp* has been designed with great care to be as secure as
feasible, paying particular attention to simplicity and privilege
separation. However, it has not been audited by security experts. Do
not run it on especially sensitive computers.

The main process runs as root and accepts connections from local
users. This means that a local user may be able to take over the
entire computer if there is an exploitable security hole in the code.

The main process spawns a helper process that runs under the
unprivileged user account *nobody*. Complex operations are done in the
helper process to minimize the impact of any security holes.

Matching TCP client sockets to Unix user IDs is done by calling
non-standard, undocumented kernel APIs that are different for each
OS. They are possibly buggy or subject to change in new OS versions.
*privatetcp* has some sanity checks to guard against such bugs but
they are not infallible. Do not run *privatetcp* on computers where
this makes you uneasy.

*privatetcp* does not use any configuration files or environment
variables. Its only configuration are the command line arguments that
specify which ports to use. This makes it difficult to configure
incorrectly. It does call out to standard system libraries that read
`/etc/services`, `/etc/passwd` and possibly other files.

*privatetcp* puts some effort into sanitizing its process state,
e.g. cleaning up file descriptors and environment variables, but you
should start *privatetcp* from a process supervisor that is explicitly
designed to provide a known process state.

TCP servers created by *privatetcp* are inaccessible and invisible to
remote users because they are bound to the loopback interface
(i.e. localhost or 127.0.0.1) instead of an external network
interface.

To reduce the complexity of code running as root, IPv6 is not
supported. TCP servers always bind to `127.0.0.1` and never to `::1`.
DNS is not used directly. Unix user lookups under NIS/YP may invoke
DNS.
